# Connecting Google Merchant Center

To list your products on Google Shopping, you must connect your Google Merchant Center (GMC) account to Ads Magic.

## The Connection Flow

1.  Go to **Ads Magic > Settings** in WordPress.
2.  Click the **"Google"** tab.
3.  Click the **"Sign in with Google"** button.
    * *Note:* Ensure you sign in with the Google account that has admin access to your GMC account.
4.  Grant the requested permissions (Manage Merchant Center).
5.  Once connected, select your **Merchant Center ID** from the dropdown list.
6.  Click **"Save & Sync"**.

## Verification
Go to your [Google Merchant Center](https://merchants.google.com/) dashboard. Check the **Products > Feeds** section. You should see a new feed named `Ads Magic Content API` with a status of "Processing" or "Success".
