# The Feed Health Check

Most plugins just generate a file. Ads Magic performs a **Profit Audit** to ensure that file actually makes you money.

## How to Run It
1.  Go to **Ads Magic > Dashboard**.
2.  The scan runs automatically upon loading.
3.  Look at the **"Feed Health"** card at the top.

## Understanding the Status

### 🟢 Healthy (Green)
Your data is clean. You are ready to sync to Google Merchant Center.

### 🟡 Warning (Yellow)
Your feed will work, but it's not optimized.
* *Example:* "Missing Brand attribute" or "Short Description."
* *Impact:* Lower ad rank, but not disapproval.

### 🔴 Critical (Red)
**Stop!** These errors will get your products disapproved or your account suspended.
* *Example:* "Missing GTIN," "Price Mismatch," or "Missing Image."
* *Action:* You must fix these before enabling the feed.

:::tip Pro Tip
Click the **"Fix"** button next to any error to jump directly to the product edit screen or bulk editor.
