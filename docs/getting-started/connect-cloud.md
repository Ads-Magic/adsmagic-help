# Unlocking the "Magician" Tier

The free plugin handles your basic XML feeds. To unlock **Real-Time Sync** (instant price updates) and **Server-Side Tracking** (CAPI), you must connect to our Cloud Engine.

## The Connection Flow

1.  Go to **Ads Magic** in your WordPress Admin.
2.  Click the **"Connect to Ads Magic Cloud"** tab and follow the instructions, or click the blue **"Connect Now"** button at the top of the Ad Magic plugin pages.
3.  A popup window will appear asking you to **"Sign in with Google"**.
    * *Note:* This creates your secure account on `app.adsmagic.us`.
4.  Authorize the connection.
5.  The popup will close, and your plugin dashboard will reload.

## What Changed?
You will now see a **"Connected"** badge.
* **Real-Time Sync:** Enabled. Price changes now push to Google in <5 minutes.
* **CAPI:** Enabled. We are now capturing server-side conversion events.
