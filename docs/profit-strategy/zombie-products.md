# The Zombie Product Report

A "Zombie Product" is an item that gets clicks (spends money) but has **Zero Sales** over a long period (30+ days). These products silently kill your ROAS.

## How to Find Them
*(Requires Archmage Tier)*

1.  Go to **Ads Magic Cloud > Dashboard**.
2.  Click **"Profit Analysis"**.
3.  Sort the product table by **"Spend"** (High to Low).
4.  Filter for **"ROAS < 0.5"** or **"Orders = 0"**.

## The Cure
Once you identify a Zombie, you have three options:

1.  **Kill It:** Exclude it from the feed using a **Custom Filter** ("Exclude if ID = 123").
2.  **Fix It:** Often, the price is too high or the image is bad. Check the **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**. If CTR is low, fix the image. If CTR is high but conversion is low, fix the price.
3.  **Optimize It:** Use our **Gen AI** tool to rewrite the title and description to match search intent better.
