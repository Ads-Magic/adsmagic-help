# Using AI to Optimize Product Titles

Google Shopping relies heavily on your **Product Title** to match search queries. If your title is generic ("Blue Shirt"), you lose traffic. Ads Magic uses Generative AI to rewrite titles for maximum relevance.

## The Strategy
We follow the proven e-commerce formula:
`[Brand] + [Gender] + [Product Type] + [Attributes (Color, Size, Material)]`

* **Original:** "Classic Tee"
* **AI Rewritten:** "Nike Men's Classic Cotton T-Shirt - Navy Blue - Size L"

## How to Use It
*(Requires Archmage Tier)*

1.  Go to **Ads Magic Cloud > Optimization**.
2.  Select **"AI Rewrite"**.
3.  Choose the products you want to optimize (or "Select All").
4.  Click **"Generate Titles"**.
5.  Review the suggestions and click **"Apply"** to push them to your Google Feed.
    * *Note:* This does NOT change the title on your actual website, only in the feed.
