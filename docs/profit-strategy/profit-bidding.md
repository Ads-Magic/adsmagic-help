# Profit-Based Bidding Strategies (POAS)

Once you are tracking **Profit** as a custom metric in Google Ads, you can move beyond simple ROAS targets.

## Strategy 1: The "Break-Even" POAS
* **Goal:** Maximize volume without losing money.
* **Target:** **POAS = 1.0 (100%)**
* **Logic:** If Profit / Ad Spend = 1, you effectively spent your entire profit margin on the ad, but acquired a customer for "free" (break-even). Future LTV is pure profit.

## Strategy 2: The "Growth" POAS
* **Goal:** Scale aggressively while maintaining a safety margin.
* **Target:** **POAS = 1.2 - 1.5**
* **Logic:** You are making $1.20 to $1.50 in *profit* for every $1.00 spent on ads. This is a healthy growth zone.

## Strategy 3: The "Cash Cow" POAS
* **Goal:** Maximize immediate cash flow.
* **Target:** **POAS = 3.0+**
* **Logic:** You require $3 in profit for every $1 spent. Volume will be lower, but every sale is highly profitable. Use this for limited inventory or established products.

:::tip
Start with a **tROAS** (Target ROAS) strategy using your calculated **Break-Even ROAS** based on your average margin, then transition to POAS columns for analysis before fully switching bidding models.
