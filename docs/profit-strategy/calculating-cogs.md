# How to Input Cost of Goods (COGS)

To calculate **Net Profit** and **POAS**, Ads Magic needs to know how much each product costs you to buy or make.

## Where to Enter Data

### Option A: The "All Products" List (Quick)
1.  Go to **Products > All Products** in WordPress.
2.  We add a **"Cost"** column to this list.
3.  Click the **"Quick Edit"** button on any product.
4.  Enter the value in the **"Cost ($)"** field.
5.  Click Update.

### Option B: Bulk Edit (Fastest)
1.  Select multiple products using the checkboxes.
2.  Select **Edit** from the "Bulk Actions" dropdown and click Apply.
3.  Enter a value in the **Cost** field to apply it to all selected items (good for uniform costs).

### Option C: Import via CSV
If you have thousands of products:
1.  Use the standard WooCommerce CSV Importer.
2.  Map your CSV cost column to the meta field: `_adsmagic_cost`.
