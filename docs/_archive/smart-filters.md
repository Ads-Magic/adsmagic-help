# Using Smart Filters to Exclude Products

You don't want to pay for clicks on products that are out of stock or unprofitable. **Smart Filters** allow you to exclude these items from your Google Feed automatically.

## Common Filter Rules

### Rule 1: Exclude Out of Stock
* *Condition:* If `Stock Status` is **"Out of Stock"**
* *Action:* **Exclude from Feed**
* *Why:* Google hates clicks on out-of-stock items and may disapprove your account.

### Rule 2: Exclude Low Price Items
* *Condition:* If `Price` is **Less Than $10**
* *Action:* **Exclude from Feed**
* *Why:* If your average CPC is $1.00, you will likely lose money on a $10 item.

### Rule 3: Exclude Low Margin (Archmage Tier)
* *Condition:* If `Margin %` is **Less Than 15%**
* *Action:* **Exclude from Feed**
* *Why:* Protect your profitability.

## How to Configure
1.  Go to **Ads Magic Cloud > Feeds**.
2.  Click **"Manage Filters"** next to your Google Feed.
3.  Click **"Add New Rule"**.
4.  Select your Condition and Value.
5.  Click **"Save & Re-Sync"**.
