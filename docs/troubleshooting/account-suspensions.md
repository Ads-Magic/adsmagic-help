# Dealing with Merchant Center Suspensions

A suspension notice from Google is scary, but usually fixable. The most common reason is **"Misrepresentation"** (Trustworthiness).

## The "Trust Audit" Checklist
Before appealing, ensure your site meets these strict standards:

1.  **Contact Info:** You must have a physical address, email, and phone number visible in your footer or Contact page.
2.  **Policies:** You must have clear "Shipping," "Returns," and "Privacy" policy pages linked in the footer.
3.  **Checkout:** Your checkout must be secure (HTTPS) and functional.
4.  **Price Accuracy:** The price in the feed matches the price on the page exactly. (Use our **Price Mismatch** fix).

## How Ads Magic Helps
Run a **Health Check** in the plugin. We check for:
* SSL Certificate validity.
* Price consistency.
* Missing policy pages.

**Next Step:** Once you have fixed these items, go to Google Merchant Center > Account Issues and click **"Request Review."**
