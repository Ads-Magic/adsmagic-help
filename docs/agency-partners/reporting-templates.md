# Generating Agency Profit Reports

Stop spending hours manually merging CSVs. As an Ads Magic Partner, you can generate branded **"Profit Intelligence Reports"** for your clients in one click.

## What's Inside the Report
The report consolidates data from WooCommerce, Google Ads, and Meta Ads into a single view:
1.  **Total Revenue vs. Ad Spend:** The "Big Picture."
2.  **Net Profit Trend:** Is the client actually making money?
3.  **POAS by Channel:** Which platform is driving the most *profit* (not just revenue)?
4.  **Top 10 Products:** Best sellers by margin contribution.

## How to Generate It
1.  Log in to your **Partner Dashboard**.
2.  Select the **Client Account**.
3.  Go to **Reports > Monthly Summary**.
4.  Select the **Date Range** (e.g., Last Month).
5.  Click **"Download PDF"** (Your agency logo will be automatically applied).

:::tip
Schedule this report to be emailed to you automatically on the 1st of every month, so you can review it before forwarding it to the client.
