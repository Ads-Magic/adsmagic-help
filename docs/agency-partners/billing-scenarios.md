# Managing Agency Billing Scenarios

As an Agency Partner, you have flexibility in how you bill your clients for Ads Magic. Here are the most common models.

## Model A: The "Value-Add" (Recommended)
**You pay us, the client pays you (bundled).**
* **How it works:** You purchase a bulk license pack (e.g., 20 sites). You include "Premium Tracking & Feeds" as a line item in your monthly management retainer.
* **Pros:** You control the relationship. The client sees you as the provider of the tech stack. High margin potential.
* **Configuration:** Use **White Label Mode** to hide the "Billing" tab in the plugin.

## Model B: The "Pass-Through"
**You pay us, you invoice the client separately.**
* **How it works:** You pay for the license and send a separate invoice to the client for "Software Costs."
* **Pros:** Transparent costs. Good for clients who want itemized billing.
* **Configuration:** You can still use White Label, but explain the cost clearly.

## Model C: The "Referral"
**The client pays us directly.**
* **How it works:** You send the client your **Affiliate Link**. They sign up and pay for their own subscription.
* **Pros:** No billing administration for you. You earn a 30% recurring commission.
* **Cons:** You cannot use your Agency Master Key; the client manages the account.
