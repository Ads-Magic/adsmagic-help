# Selling Profit Intelligence to Clients

Moving your clients from "ROAS" to "POAS" (Profit on Ad Spend) is a strategic upgrade. Use this guide to explain the value of Ads Magic and justify your agency fees.

## The Problem: The "ROAS Trap"
Most clients are fixated on **ROAS**. Explain why this is dangerous:
> *"High ROAS doesn't mean high profit. If we sell $10,000 of low-margin products, you might actually lose money after ad spend and COGS. We need to optimize for what you keep, not just what you sell."*

## The Solution: The "Profit Engine"
Position Ads Magic as their new financial advantage:
1.  **True Profit Visibility:** "We will track Net Profit in real-time, factoring in product costs and ad spend."
2.  **Resilient Data:** "We will implement Server-Side Tracking to bypass ad blockers and recover lost sales data (approx. 15%)."
3.  **Real-Time Sync:** "We will prevent wasted spend on out-of-stock items by syncing inventory instantly."

## Addressing Common Objections

### "Why do I need to pay for another tool?"
**Answer:** "Standard free plugins are costing you money in lost data and wasted spend. Ads Magic pays for itself by recovering just 1-2 lost conversions per month. It's an investment in accuracy."

### "Is my data safe?"
**Answer:** "Yes. Ads Magic uses enterprise-grade encryption and hashes all customer data before it leaves your site. We are fully GDPR/CCPA compliant."
