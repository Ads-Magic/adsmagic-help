# Managing Multiple Clients (Multi-Tenant)

As an Agency Partner, you can manage all your client stores from a single **Command Center**.

## Accessing Client Accounts

1.  Log in to your **Partner Dashboard** (`app.adsmagic.us`).
2.  Click the **"Clients"** tab in the sidebar.
3.  You will see a list of all connected stores.
4.  Click **"Manage"** next to any store name.
5.  You are now viewing that specific store's dashboard. You can configure feeds, check health, and view profit reports as if you were the merchant.

## Adding a New Client
1.  Click **"Add Client"**.
2.  Enter the client's Store URL.
3.  Use your **Master API Key** to generate a connection link.
4.  Send this link to your client (or install the plugin yourself using your Agency License Key).
