# Setting Up White Label Branding

As an Agency Partner, you can rebrand the Ads Magic plugin so your clients see **your** logo and colors inside their WordPress admin.

## Configuration Steps

1.  Log in to your **Partner Dashboard** (`app.adsmagic.us`).
2.  Go to **Settings > White Label**.
3.  **Agency Name:** Enter your company name (e.g., "Apex Media").
4.  **Logo URL:** Paste the link to your logo image (Recommended: 200x50px PNG).
5.  **Menu Icon:** Upload a square icon for the WP Admin sidebar.
6.  **Color Scheme:** Choose a primary color (Hex Code) for buttons and links.
7.  Click **Save Branding**.

## Deployment
This branding automatically applies to **all** sites connected to your Master API Key. You do not need to configure each client site individually.

:::note
The "Billing" tab is automatically hidden for all White Label sub-accounts, ensuring your clients never see our wholesale pricing.
