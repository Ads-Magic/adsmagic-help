# Agency Billing & Licensing FAQ

### Q: How does the "Volume Discount" work?
**A:** You purchase "Seats" in bulk.
* **Starter Pack:** 5 Sites ($119/mo). Cost: ~$24/site.
* **Agency Pack:** 20 Sites ($399/mo). Cost: ~$20/site.
* **Network Pack:** 50 Sites ($899/mo). Cost: ~$18/site.

### Q: Can I buy just one extra seat?
**A:** Yes. If you have the Starter Pack (5 sites) and sign a 6th client, you can buy a **"Top-Up License"** for **$25/mo**. You do not need to jump to the 20-site pack immediately.

### Q: What happens if a client leaves me?
**A:** You own the license, not the client.
1.  Go to your Partner Dashboard.
2.  Click **"Deactivate"** on the old client's site.
3.  This frees up the seat.
4.  **"Activate"** the license on your new client's site.

### Q: Does the client see the price I pay?
**A:** No. If you enable **White Label Mode**, the "Billing" tab is completely hidden from the WordPress plugin. You bill the client whatever you want; we bill you the wholesale rate.
