\# Generating Agency Profit Reports

Stop spending hours manually merging CSVs. As an Ads Magic Partner, you can generate branded \*\*"Profit Intelligence Reports"\*\* for your clients in one click.

\#\# What's Inside the Report  
The report consolidates data from WooCommerce, Google Ads, and Meta Ads into a single view:  
1\.  \*\*Total Revenue vs. Ad Spend:\*\* The "Big Picture."  
2\.  \*\*Net Profit Trend:\*\* Is the client actually making money?  
3\.  \*\*POAS by Channel:\*\* Which platform is driving the most \*profit\* (not just revenue)?  
4\.  \*\*Top 10 Products:\*\* Best sellers by margin contribution.

\#\# How to Generate It  
1\.  Log in to your \*\*Partner Dashboard\*\*.  
2\.  Select the \*\*Client Account\*\*.  
3\.  Go to \*\*Reports \> Monthly Summary\*\*.  
4\.  Select the \*\*Date Range\*\* (e.g., Last Month).  
5\.  Click \*\*"Download PDF"\*\* (Your agency logo will be automatically applied).

:::tip  
Schedule this report to be emailed to you automatically on the 1st of every month, so you can review it before forwarding it to the client.

\# Using AI to Optimize Product Titles

Google Shopping relies heavily on your \*\*Product Title\*\* to match search queries. If your title is generic ("Blue Shirt"), you lose traffic. Ads Magic uses Generative AI to rewrite titles for maximum relevance.

\#\# The Strategy  
We follow the proven e-commerce formula:  
\`\[Brand\] \+ \[Gender\] \+ \[Product Type\] \+ \[Attributes (Color, Size, Material)\]\`

\* \*\*Original:\*\* "Classic Tee"  
\* \*\*AI Rewritten:\*\* "Nike Men's Classic Cotton T-Shirt \- Navy Blue \- Size L"

\#\# How to Use It  
\*(Requires Archmage Tier)\*

1\.  Go to \*\*Ads Magic Cloud \> Optimization\*\*.  
2\.  Select \*\*"AI Rewrite"\*\*.  
3\.  Choose the products you want to optimize (or "Select All").  
4\.  Click \*\*"Generate Titles"\*\*.  
5\.  Review the suggestions and click \*\*"Apply"\*\* to push them to your Google Feed.  
    \* \*Note:\* This does NOT change the title on your actual website, only in the feed.

\# Creating Custom Labels for Bidding

\*\*Custom Labels\*\* (0-4) allow you to group products in Google Ads for specific bidding strategies. Ads Magic can populate these dynamically based on your data.

\#\# Popular Strategies

\#\#\# Strategy A: Margin Buckets (The "Profit" Play)  
Group products by how much money they make you.  
\* \*\*Label 0:\*\* "High Margin" (\> 50%)  
\* \*\*Label 0:\*\* "Low Margin" (\< 20%)  
\* \*Action:\* Bid aggressively on "High Margin" products; bid conservatively on "Low Margin."

\#\#\# Strategy B: Price Tiers (The "AOV" Play)  
Group products by selling price.  
\* \*\*Label 1:\*\* "Under $20"  
\* \*\*Label 1:\*\* "Over $100"  
\* \*Action:\* Use different ROAS targets for cheap vs. expensive items.

\#\# How to Set It Up  
1\.  Go to \*\*Ads Magic Cloud \> Feeds \> Custom Labels\*\*.  
2\.  Select \*\*Custom Label 0\*\*.  
3\.  Choose \*\*"Dynamic Rule"\*\*.  
4\.  Set Logic: \`If \[Margin\] \> 50% then "High Margin"\`.  
5\.  Save & Sync.

\# Agency Billing & Licensing FAQ

\#\#\# Q: How does the "Volume Discount" work?  
\*\*A:\*\* You purchase "Seats" in bulk.  
\* \*\*Starter Pack:\*\* 5 Sites ($119/mo). Cost: \~$24/site.  
\* \*\*Agency Pack:\*\* 20 Sites ($399/mo). Cost: \~$20/site.  
\* \*\*Network Pack:\*\* 50 Sites ($899/mo). Cost: \~$18/site.

\#\#\# Q: Can I buy just one extra seat?  
\*\*A:\*\* Yes. If you have the Starter Pack (5 sites) and sign a 6th client, you can buy a \*\*"Top-Up License"\*\* for \*\*$25/mo\*\*. You do not need to jump to the 20-site pack immediately.

\#\#\# Q: What happens if a client leaves me?  
\*\*A:\*\* You own the license, not the client.  
1\.  Go to your Partner Dashboard.  
2\.  Click \*\*"Deactivate"\*\* on the old client's site.  
3\.  This frees up the seat.  
4\.  \*\*"Activate"\*\* the license on your new client's site.

\#\#\# Q: Does the client see the price I pay?  
\*\*A:\*\* No. If you enable \*\*White Label Mode\*\*, the "Billing" tab is completely hidden from the WordPress plugin. You bill the client whatever you want; we bill you the wholesale rate.
