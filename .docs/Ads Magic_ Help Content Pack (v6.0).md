\# Selling Profit Intelligence to Clients

Moving your clients from "ROAS" to "POAS" (Profit on Ad Spend) is a strategic upgrade. Use this guide to explain the value of Ads Magic and justify your agency fees.

\#\# The Problem: The "ROAS Trap"  
Most clients are fixated on \*\*ROAS\*\*. Explain why this is dangerous:  
\> \*"High ROAS doesn't mean high profit. If we sell $10,000 of low-margin products, you might actually lose money after ad spend and COGS. We need to optimize for what you keep, not just what you sell."\*

\#\# The Solution: The "Profit Engine"  
Position Ads Magic as their new financial advantage:  
1\.  \*\*True Profit Visibility:\*\* "We will track Net Profit in real-time, factoring in product costs and ad spend."  
2\.  \*\*Resilient Data:\*\* "We will implement Server-Side Tracking to bypass ad blockers and recover lost sales data (approx. 15%)."  
3\.  \*\*Real-Time Sync:\*\* "We will prevent wasted spend on out-of-stock items by syncing inventory instantly."

\#\# Addressing Common Objections

\#\#\# "Why do I need to pay for another tool?"  
\*\*Answer:\*\* "Standard free plugins are costing you money in lost data and wasted spend. Ads Magic pays for itself by recovering just 1-2 lost conversions per month. It's an investment in accuracy."

\#\#\# "Is my data safe?"  
\*\*Answer:\*\* "Yes. Ads Magic uses enterprise-grade encryption and hashes all customer data before it leaves your site. We are fully GDPR/CCPA compliant."

\# Managing Agency Billing Scenarios

As an Agency Partner, you have flexibility in how you bill your clients for Ads Magic. Here are the most common models.

\#\# Model A: The "Value-Add" (Recommended)  
\*\*You pay us, the client pays you (bundled).\*\*  
\* \*\*How it works:\*\* You purchase a bulk license pack (e.g., 20 sites). You include "Premium Tracking & Feeds" as a line item in your monthly management retainer.  
\* \*\*Pros:\*\* You control the relationship. The client sees you as the provider of the tech stack. High margin potential.  
\* \*\*Configuration:\*\* Use \*\*White Label Mode\*\* to hide the "Billing" tab in the plugin.

\#\# Model B: The "Pass-Through"  
\*\*You pay us, you invoice the client separately.\*\*  
\* \*\*How it works:\*\* You pay for the license and send a separate invoice to the client for "Software Costs."  
\* \*\*Pros:\*\* Transparent costs. Good for clients who want itemized billing.  
\* \*\*Configuration:\*\* You can still use White Label, but explain the cost clearly.

\#\# Model C: The "Referral"  
\*\*The client pays us directly.\*\*  
\* \*\*How it works:\*\* You send the client your \*\*Affiliate Link\*\*. They sign up and pay for their own subscription.  
\* \*\*Pros:\*\* No billing administration for you. You earn a 30% recurring commission.  
\* \*\*Cons:\*\* You cannot use your Agency Master Key; the client manages the account.

\# Setting Up Google Enhanced Conversions

\*\*Enhanced Conversions\*\* allows Google Ads to match more sales to ad clicks by using hashed customer data (email, phone, address) captured at checkout. This is the Google equivalent of Meta's CAPI.

\#\# Why Enable It?  
\* \*\*Recover Data:\*\* Matches users who might not have a cookie (cross-device, incognito).  
\* \*\*Improve Bidding:\*\* Gives Google's AI better data to optimize your campaigns.

\#\# Setup Steps

1\.  \*\*Enable in Google Ads:\*\*  
    \* Go to \*\*Google Ads \> Goals \> Conversions\*\*.  
    \* Open your "Purchase" conversion action.  
    \* Expand "Enhanced conversions" and check \*\*"Turn on enhanced conversions."\*\*  
    \* Select \*\*"API"\*\* as the method.

2\.  \*\*Enable in Ads Magic:\*\*  
    \* Go to \*\*Ads Magic \> Settings \> Tracking\*\*.  
    \* Toggle \*\*"Enable Google Enhanced Conversions"\*\* to \*\*ON\*\*.  
    \* Ensure your \*\*Conversion ID\*\* and \*\*Label\*\* are correct.  
    \* Click \*\*Save\*\*.

\#\# Verification  
Wait 24-48 hours. Check the "Diagnostics" tab in your Google Ads Conversion settings. You should see a status of \*\*"Recording (Enhanced Conversions)"\*\*.

\# Profit-Based Bidding Strategies (POAS)

Once you are tracking \*\*Profit\*\* as a custom metric in Google Ads, you can move beyond simple ROAS targets.

\#\# Strategy 1: The "Break-Even" POAS  
\* \*\*Goal:\*\* Maximize volume without losing money.  
\* \*\*Target:\*\* \*\*POAS \= 1.0 (100%)\*\*  
\* \*\*Logic:\*\* If Profit / Ad Spend \= 1, you effectively spent your entire profit margin on the ad, but acquired a customer for "free" (break-even). Future LTV is pure profit.

\#\# Strategy 2: The "Growth" POAS  
\* \*\*Goal:\*\* Scale aggressively while maintaining a safety margin.  
\* \*\*Target:\*\* \*\*POAS \= 1.2 \- 1.5\*\*  
\* \*\*Logic:\*\* You are making $1.20 to $1.50 in \*profit\* for every $1.00 spent on ads. This is a healthy growth zone.

\#\# Strategy 3: The "Cash Cow" POAS  
\* \*\*Goal:\*\* Maximize immediate cash flow.  
\* \*\*Target:\*\* \*\*POAS \= 3.0+\*\*  
\* \*\*Logic:\*\* You require $3 in profit for every $1 spent. Volume will be lower, but every sale is highly profitable. Use this for limited inventory or established products.

:::tip  
Start with a \*\*tROAS\*\* (Target ROAS) strategy using your calculated \*\*Break-Even ROAS\*\* based on your average margin, then transition to POAS columns for analysis before fully switching bidding models.

\# Using Profit Margin for Custom Labels

One of the most powerful features of the \*\*Archmage\*\* tier is the ability to dynamically assign \*\*Custom Labels\*\* (0-4) based on your product's profit margin.

\#\# Why Do This?  
Google Shopping campaigns bid on groups of products. By grouping products with similar margins, you can set the perfect ROAS target for each group.

\#\# Configuration Guide

1\.  Go to \*\*Ads Magic Cloud \> Feeds \> Custom Labels\*\*.  
2\.  Select \*\*Custom Label 0\*\* (or any available slot).  
3\.  Choose \*\*"Dynamic Rule"\*\*.  
4\.  \*\*Create Rule 1 (High Margin):\*\*  
    \* \*Condition:\* If \`Margin %\` is \*\*Greater Than 50%\*\*  
    \* \*Value:\* \`High Margin\`  
5\.  \*\*Create Rule 2 (Low Margin):\*\*  
    \* \*Condition:\* If \`Margin %\` is \*\*Less Than 20%\*\*  
    \* \*Value:\* \`Low Margin\`  
6\.  \*\*Create Rule 3 (Medium Margin):\*\*  
    \* \*Condition:\* Default (Matches everything else)  
    \* \*Value:\* \`Medium Margin\`  
7\.  Click \*\*Save & Sync\*\*.

\#\# In Google Ads  
1\.  Create a \*\*Standard Shopping\*\* or \*\*PMax\*\* campaign.  
2\.  Subdivide your product groups by \*\*Custom Label 0\*\*.  
3\.  Set aggressive bids for "High Margin" and conservative bids for "Low Margin."
